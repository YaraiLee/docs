# Introduction to block and transaction structure

## 1. Block structure of GXChain

- A block contains some transactions, a transaction contains the some operations, and a opreation contains the functions such as calling contract, voting, transfering, etc.


- We can get the most intuitive understanding of GXChain through GXChain's block structure. A complete block contains the following information:

``` json
{
  "previous": "0092ab99afb1a7bc9107d85796ce7219214c5700",                   //ID of the previous block
  "timestamp": "2018-12-12T07:44:18",                                       //Generate timestamp of the block

}
```
## 2. Operation

The GXChain block contains multiple operations, and each operation corresponds to a Code number. According to the Code numbers, We can judge which operations are included in the block according to Code numbers. For example, the block [1769028](https://block.gxb.io/#/block/1769028) contains a transfer transaction, and Code 0 corresponds to the transfer operation. The correspondence between Code and operation which are often used :

| Code | Operation Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| 0 | transfer |
| 5 | create account |
| 6 | update account |
| 73 | proxy transfer |
| 74 | deploy contract |
| 75 | call contract |
| 76 | update contract |

## 3. Object on GXChain

The data structure of the related type on GXChain is saved by the object, the object ID is its identifier (format: x.x.x), and the instance id of the object is the last digit of the object ID. Example: The nathan account ID is 1.2.17, the instance id is 17; the GXC asset ID is 1.3.1, the instance id is 1, and the common object types are as follows:

| ID | Object Type |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1.2.x | Account object |
| 1.3.x | Asset object |
| 1.5.x | Committee object |
| 1.6.x | Witness object |
| 1.10.x | Proposal object |
| 1.11.x | Operation history object |
| 1.13.x | To unfreeze balance object |
| 1.14.x | Budget item object |
| 1.25.x | Loyalty program freezes balance object |
| 2.0.0 | System global parameter object |
| 2.1.x | Dynamic parameter object |
| 2.3.x | Asset dynamic parameter object |
| 2.5.x | Account balance object |
| 2.6.x | Account statistics object |
| 2.7.x | Transaction object |
| 2.8.x | Block abstract object |
| 2.9.x | Account transaction history object |
| 2.12.x | Witness schedule object|
