# Quick start
## Overview

This tutorial provides guidance for GXChain smart contract development, including contract development, deployment, debugs, and common errors.

The GXChain smart contract is developed in C++, compiled by the [Webassembly](https://webassembly.org/) virtual machine and deployed on the GXChain blockchain network. The compiled smart contract includes the abi file and the wast file, the `abi` file is the interface file defined by the contract, and the `wast` file is the bytecode file executed by the Webassembly virtual machine. The GXChain smart uses WebAssembly virtual machine to support smart contracts written in multiple languages ​​such as C++ and TypeScript.

**Before developing a smart contract, you need to do the following:**

- Experience in C++ language development
- Experience with Linux or Mac
- Compile the source to start the local private chain or download the release program to connect to the test network (source compilation tutorial point [here](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core)）

**Related terms:**

- **Action**：The external interface provided by the contract can be interacted with by the front end, and the action invoked by the user is recorded in the block.
- **Table**：The contract provides persistent storage, similar to the table in the database, supports multiple index, and the table is stored under the contract account object.

**Tool introduction**
- **witness_node**：The node program is used to produce blocks, which can start different functions according to different configurations. For example, the startup RPC port interacts with cli_wallet to call the contract and lookup table.
- **cli_wallet**：The command line wallet is mainly used to manage the wallet and interact with witness_node program.
- **gxx**：Used to compile `C++` files into abi files and wasm files for deployment to GXChain.

### 1. Start witness_node

You need to compile the source code to start the private chain, and then switch to the directory where the witness_node program is located, use the following command to start the node, the `data` directory to save the configuration information, the generated block information, etc. Start the private chain tutorial click [here](../advanced/private_chain.md )

```bash
./witness_node -d data
```

**It is recommended to synchronize the test network node and then develop the contract. Start the test network node tutorial click [here](../advanced/testnet.md)**


![](./png/chain_id.jpg)

Switch to the `cli_wallet` directory, start the `cli_wallet` client and connect to the `witness_node`. The `cli_wallet` program features include creating accounts, deploying contracts, calling contracts, and more. (`chain-id` is replaced with your `chain-id`)

```bash
./cli_wallet -sws://localhost:11011 --chain-id=679beed54a9081edfd3ede349a0aa1962ea2dc9d379808fecce56226cb199c84
```

![](./png/cli_wallet.jpg)


### 2. Create a new wallet


You need to create a new password for your wallet, and the wallet password is used to unlock your wallet. In the tutorial we use the following password: `supersecret`, you can also use a combination of letters and numbers to create your own password.

```bash
>>> set_password supersecret
```

Now you can unlock your new wallet:

```bash
unlock supersecret
```

### 3. Claim initial balances

To add assets to your wallet, you need the account name and the private key of the account.
In the example, we will import the `nathan` account initialized in `my-genesis.json` into the existing wallet by the `import_key` command:

```bash
import_key nathan 5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
```

::: warning note
* `nathan` will be used to define the account name in the initial file. If you have modified the `my-genesies.json` file, you can fill in a different name. Also, please note that `5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3` is the private key defined in `config.ini`
:::

Now that we have imported the private key into the wallet, the balance initialized in `my-genesis.json` needs to be claimed by the `import_balance` command.

```bash
import_balance nathan ["5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3"] true
```

You can view your account by the following command:

```bash
get_account nathan
```

Use the following command to get the account balance:

```bash
list_account_balances nathan
```

### 4. Create account

Now we will create a new account `alpha` so that we can revolve in the two accounts `nathan` and `alpha`.

Usually we use an existing account to create a new account because the registrar is required to pay the registration fee. Also, the registrar's account needs to enter the state of `Also, there is the requirement lifetime member (LTM)`. So we must upgrade the account `nathan` to the LTM state and the `upgrade_account` command to upgrade the account before creating a new account:

```bash
upgrade_account nathan GXC true
```
In the returned information, you will find `2106-02-07T06:28:15` on the side of `membership_expiration_date`. If you see `1970-01-01T00:00:00`, it means that the previous operation has an error and the `nathan` upgrade failed.

After a successful upgrade, we can register a new account with `nathan`, but first we need to have the public key for the new account. Generate a public-private key pair by using the `suggest_brain_key` command:

```bash
suggest_brain_key
```

Call the `register_account` / `register_account2` interface to create a new account.

```bash
register_account alpha GXC6vQtDEgHSickqe9itW8fbFyUrKZK5xsg4FRHzQZ7hStaWqEKhZ GXC6vQtDEgHSickqe9itW8fbFyUrKZK5xsg4FRHzQZ7hStaWqEKhZ nathan nathan 10 true
```

Transfer some assets to the account using the `transfer3` command

```bash
transfer3 nathan alpha 1000 GXC test GXC true
```

Use the following command to get the asset balance:

```bash
list_account_balances alpha
```
## Hello World

Before reading this tutorial, assume that you have already read the [Overview](#overview)

### 1. Function introduction

####  1.0 Introduction

[Hello World](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core/tree/dev_master/contracts/examples/helloworld)
This is the simplest GXChain contract, and we can master the basic process of smart contract development through this contract. The contract implements a `hi` action, which is the interface provided by the contract to the external call. The function is to print the `hi user ` string to the console twice. 

![](./png/console_print.jpg)

####  1.1 Compile contract
Smart contracts include xxx.hpp files and xxx.cpp files, which need to be compiled into xxx.wast files and xxx.abi files to be deployed on the blockchain. You can compile the wast and abi files using the gxx tool provided by GXChain, which can be found in the directory `~/gxb-core/build/tools/gxx`.

```bash
./gxx -o /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld/helloworld.wast /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld/helloworld.cpp

./gxx -g /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld/helloworld.abi /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld/helloworld.hpp
```
####  1.2 Deployment contract

You can deploy the Hello World contract, `hello` for the contract username, `nathan` for the account that pays the fee, `0 0` for the virtual machine type and version, `/Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld` is the contract path, GXC indicates the fee type, and true indicates the broadcast.

```bash
deploy_contract hello nathan 0 0 /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/examples/helloworld GXC true
```

::: warning note
* When deploying the contract, the account that pays the fee must have imported the private key (the above payment account is `nathan`), and the account balance is sufficient to pay the handling fee.
:::

####  1.3 Call contract

You can attach assets when you call the contract interface. This will send the asset to the contract account. The assets of the contract account can only be controlled by the contract's own code.

```bash

call_contract nathan hello null hi "{\"user\":\"gxchain!!!\"}" GXC true

call_contract nathan hello {"amount":10000000,"asset_id":1.3.1} hi "{\"user\":\"gxchain!!!\"}" GXC true

```

::: warning // @abi payable means attached assets
```cpp
// @abi action
// @abi payable
void hi(std::string user)
{
	    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 2; ++i) {
            print("hi, ", user, "\n");
        }
    }
}
```
:::

### 2. Code

The `Hello World` Smart Contract contains only one action and is the simplest smart contract.

The development contract requires **to define a contract class and provide an apply interface**, which can be defined using the system-provided `GRAPHENE_ABI`.


The directory where the header file is located is `/Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/gxb-core/contracts/graphenelib` (change to your directory). After importing the header file, you can use the built-in type of the contract and the built-in api function. The next tutorial analyzes a more complex smart contract - red packet contract.

## Red Packet

Before reading this tutorial, assume that you have already read the [Overview](#overview)

### 1. Function introduction

####  1.0 Introduction

[Red Packet](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core/tree/dev_master/contracts/examples/redpacket)is a relatively complex contract, we can learn the multi-index table, built-in API calls and other functions to pass the contract.

> Note: Calling the issue action can be accompanied by an asset; if the red packet is not grabbed, the issuer can close the red packet and the balance is refunded.

```bash
# Pubkey is a randomly generated password (GXC public key). The following call indicates that 5 red packets are sent, and the total amount is 11 GXC (1.3.1 indicates GXC assets).
unlocked >>> call_contract nathan redpacket {"amount":1100000,"asset_id":1.3.1} issue "{\"pubkey\":\"GXC81z4c6gEHw57TxHfZyzjA52djZzYGX7KN8sJQcDyg6yitwov5b\",\"number\":5}" GXC true
{
  "ref_block_num": 15124,
  ...
  ...
  ...
  "signatures": [
    "1f7fade01ef08d986282164c1428fee37ecc5817c4e6bdc7c160220cf965b881d7417874ab22be48047becf62936e6a060a3e06c65e3548e90a72ddc1720794db3"
  ]
}
# View the contract account assets, the current contract only issued one red packet, the balance is 11 GXC
unlocked >>> list_account_balances redpacket
11 GXC

# View the contract table, 'subpackets' are randomly divided into 5 sub-red packets, 'pub_key' is used to verify the signature
unlocked >>> get_table_rows redpacket packet 0 -1
[{
    "issuer": 17,
    "pub_key": "GXC81z4c6gEHw57TxHfZyzjA52djZzYGX7KN8sJQcDyg6yitwov5b",
    "total_amount": {
      "amount": 1100000,
      "asset_id": 1
    },
    "number": 5,
    "subpackets": [
      350531,
      150227,
      390591,
      66767,
      141884
    ]
  }
]

```

Opening the red packet requires knowing the private key of the password (public key). The known password is: `GXC81z4c6gEHw57TxHfZyzjA52djZzYGX7KN8sJQcDyg6yitwov5b`, then you need to know the private key of the password (`5J9vj4XiwVQ2HNr22uFrxgaaerqrPN7xZQER9z2hwSPeWdbMKBM`). Then use the private key to sign the user instanceid (using the `sign_string` interface provided by `cli_wallet` to sign, the instanceid is the last field of the account id, for example, the account id of `nathan` is `1.2.17`, and the instanceid is 17)

```bash
#Sign the instanceid with a private key
unlocked >>> get_account_id nathan
"1.2.17"
unlocked >>> sign_string 5J9vj4XiwVQ2HNr22uFrxgaaerqrPN7xZQER9z2hwSPeWdbMKBM 17

#The sub-red packet sequence is reduced from 5 to 4, and the reduced item is 390591, which means 3.90591 GXC is taken away.
unlocked >>> get_table_rows redpacket packet 0 -1
[{
    "issuer": 17,
    "pub_key": "GXC81z4c6gEHw57TxHfZyzjA52djZzYGX7KN8sJQcDyg6yitwov5b",

# Close red packet
unlocked >>> call_contract nathan redpacket null close "{}" GXC true
```

### 2. Code

- Comments // @abi payable means that the action can be accompanied by assets, which can be used to generate the correct abi file
```cpp
// @abi action
// @abi payable
void issue(std::string pubkey, uint64_t number){
	...
}
```

- Use the 'graphene_assert' function to roll back the action when it fails
```cpp
graphene_assert(pubkey.size() > prefix_len, "invalid public key");
graphene_assert(pubkey.substr(0, prefix_len) == prefix, "invalid public key");
```

- Call the built-in API
```cpp
int64_t total_amount = get_action_asset_amount();
```

- Introduction of multi-index table

```cpp

//@abi table packet i64
struct packet {
    uint64_t                issuer;
    std::string             pub_key;
    contract_asset          total_amount;
    uint32_t                number;
    vector<int64_t>         subpackets;							// Can use vector, struct, and built-in types

    uint64_t primary_key() const { return issuer; }				// Define a primary key function, the returned value is unique as the primary key index.

    GRAPHENE_SERIALIZE(packet, (issuer)(pub_key)(total_amount)(number)(subpackets))
};

// Declare an instance of a multi-indexed table type
typedef graphene::multi_index<N(packet), packet> packet_index;
packet_index            packets;

// Add item
packets.emplace(owner, [&](auto &o) {
    o.issuer = owner;
    ...
});
// Modify item
packets.modify(packet_iter, sender, [&](auto &o) {
            o.subpackets.erase(subpacket_it);
});
// Erase item
packets.erase(packet_iter);
``` 
## Bank

Before reading this tutorial, assume that you have already read the [Overview](#overview)


### 1. Function introduction

####  1.0 Introduction

[Bank](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core/tree/dev_master/contracts/examples/bank)contracts can deposit and withdraw assets. There are two action interfaces, one is the 'deposit'. When the user calls the interface, the additional token assets are the assets that the user needs to deposit. The second is to withdraw assets and can be withdrawn to the account. Contains an `account table`, including a list of user ids and their deposited assets.

```bash
// Call the 'deposit' interface to deposit 10GXC to the bank contract
unlocked >>> call_contract nathan bank {"amount":1000000,"asset_id":1.3.1} deposit "{}" GXC true
{
  {
  "ref_block_num": 36472,
  "ref_block_prefix": 290922209,
  "expiration": "2018-11-20T09:19:40",
  "operations": [[
  ...
  ...
}
//View the account table in the contract, get the account balance
unlocked >>> get_table_rows bank account 0 -1
[{
    "owner": 17,
    "balances": [{
        "amount": 1000000,
        "asset_id": 1
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

```bash
// Call the cash 'withdraw' interface to withdraw 1GXC to the hello account
unlocked >>> call_contract nathan bank null withdraw "{\"to_account\":\"hello\",\"amount\":{\"asset_id\":1,\"amount\":100000}}" GXC true
{
  "ref_block_num": 36733,
  "ref_block_prefix": 1321509121,
  "expiration": "2018-11-20T09:42:10",
  ...
  ...
}
// View 'hello' account balance
unlocked >>> list_account_balances hello
1 GXC
```
####  1.1 Compile contract

```bash
./gxx -g /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/bank/bank.abi /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/bank/bank.cpp

./gxx -o /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/bank/bank.wast /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/bank/bank.cpp
```

####  1.2 Deployment contract


```bash
deploy_contract bank nathan 0 0 /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/bank GXC true
```

#### 1.3 Call contract

```bash
# Deposit asset
call_contract nathan bank {"amount":1000000,"asset_id":1.3.1} deposit "{}" GXC true

# Withdraw asset
call_contract nathan bank null withdraw "{\"to_account\":\"hello\",\"amount\":{\"asset_id\":1,\"amount\":100000}}" GXC true
```

### 2. Code

Table stores the user id and the list of assets
```cpp
//The primary key is instance_id, and the balances field is the list of assets stored by the user.
//@abi table account i64
struct account {
    uint64_t owner;
    std::vector<contract_asset> balances;  

    uint64_t primary_key() const { return owner; }

    GRAPHENE_SERIALIZE(account, (owner)(balances))
};
```
'deposit' is an interface with no parameters. You can deposit by attaching assets. The interface function includes obtaining additional asset information (asset id, asset quantity), traversing 'table', and adding asset information to the table.

:::warning Note
The table field can only be modified by the 'modify' interface provided by GXChain. It cannot be modified using the iterator obtained by traversal. The iterator type returned by the find method is const.
:::
```cpp
// Payable means that the action can attach assets
// @abi action
// @abi payable
void deposit()
{
    // Obtain additional 'asset_id' and 'asset_amount' by 'get_action_asset_amount' and 'get_action_asset_id' functions
    int64_t asset_amount = get_action_asset_amount();
    uint64_t asset_id = get_action_asset_id();
    contract_asset amount{asset_amount, asset_id};

    // Get caller account_id
    uint64_t owner = get_trx_sender();
    auto it = accounts.find(owner);
    // If the caller has not deposited assets, create a table entry for it, the primary key is the 'instance_id'
    if (it == accounts.end()) {
        accounts.emplace(owner, [&](auto &o) {
            o.owner = owner;
            o.balances.emplace_back(amount);
        });
    } else {
        uint16_t asset_index = std::distance(it->balances.begin(),
                                             find_if(it->balances.begin(), it->balances.end(), [&](const auto &a) { return a.asset_id == asset_id; }));
        if (asset_index < it->balances.size()) {
            // The 'contract_asset' class overloads the '+=' operator
            accounts.modify(it, 0, [&](auto &o) { o.balances[asset_index] += amount; });
        } else {
            accounts.modify(it, 0, [&](auto &o) { o.balances.emplace_back(amount); });
        }
    }
}

```

The `withdraw` interface has two parameters, the first parameter is the account name (not the account id), and the second is the asset object (the asset id and the number of withdrawals). If the validation request passes, the built-in api (withdraw_asset) is called to withdraw the asset to the account.
```cpp
// @abi action
void withdraw(std::string to_account, contract_asset amount)
{
    // Get the instance_id by account name, this is the account that needs to be withdrawn
    int64_t account_id = get_account_id(to_account.c_str(), to_account.size());
    graphene_assert(account_id >= 0, "invalid account_name to_account");
    graphene_assert(amount.amount > 0, "invalid amount");

    // Get the caller account id
    uint64_t owner = get_trx_sender();
    auto it = accounts.find(owner);
    graphene_assert(it != accounts.end(), "owner has no asset");

    int asset_index = 0;
    for (auto asset_it = it->balances.begin(); asset_it != it->balances.end(); ++asset_it) {
        if ((amount.asset_id) == asset_it->asset_id) {
            graphene_assert(asset_it->amount >= amount.amount, "balance not enough");
            if (asset_it->amount == amount.amount) {
                //Clear the asset status information when the user withdraws an asset.
                accounts.modify(it, 0, [&](auto &o) {
                    o.balances.erase(asset_it);
                });
                //Empty the user's ‘accounts table’ when the user asset list is empty
                if (it->balances.size() == 0) {
                    accounts.erase(it);
                }
            } else {
                accounts.modify(it, 0, [&](auto &o) {
                    o.balances[asset_index] -= amount;
                });
            }
            break;
        }
        asset_index++;
    }
    //Built-in api, withdraw assets to a specified account
    withdraw_asset(_self, account_id, amount.asset_id, amount.amount);
}
```
## Riddle

Before reading this tutorial, assume that you have already read the [Overview](#overview)

### 1. Function introduction

####  1.0 Introduction

[Riddle合约](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core/tree/dev_master/contracts/examples/riddle)is a guessing contract, including two action interfaces. The user can create a puzzle via the `issue` interface and save the hash of the answer to the blockchain. The `reveal` interface is used to verify that the answer to the puzzle is correct.

- **Create puzzles and hash of answers**

```bash
//Generate a sha256 hash of the answer, the answer is '4'
zhaoxiangfei@zhaoxiangfeideMacBook-Pro:~$ echo -n "4" | shasum -a 256

```

####  1.3 Call contract

```bash

```

### 2. Code

The 'record table' stores the puzzle and the hash of the answer. When the puzzle is cracked, the puzzle item in the table is deleted. The table primary key is instance_id, which is unique, so each user can only create a puzzle on the chain. The contract consists of two actions, the function is to create puzzles and submit answers.

```cpp
// @abi table record i64
struct record {
    uint64_t            issuer;             
    std::string         question;
    checksum256         hashed_answer;      //Checksum256 is a built-in type

    uint64_t primary_key() const { return issuer; }

    GRAPHENE_SERIALIZE(record, (issuer)(question)(hashed_answer))
};
```

- Create puzzles, submit puzzle content and hash values of answers, generate hashes using sha256 algorithm
```cpp
/// @abi action
void issue(const std::string& question, const checksum256& hashed_answer)
{
    // Get the instance_id of the caller as the primary key of the 'record table'
    uint64_t owner = get_trx_sender();
    records.emplace(owner, [&](auto &p) {
            p.issuer = owner;
            p.question = question;
            p.hashed_answer = hashed_answer;
    });
}
```
- Submit the answer and verify that the submitted answer is correct
```cpp
/// @abi action
void reveal(const std::string& issuer, const std::string& answer)
{
    int64_t issuer_id = get_account_id(issuer.c_str(), issuer.size());
    graphene_assert(issuer_id >= 0, "issuer not exist");
    auto iter = records.find(issuer_id);
    graphene_assert(iter != records.end(), "no record");

    checksum256 hashed_answer;
    sha256(const_cast<char *>(answer.c_str()), answer.length(), &hashed_answer);

    // After the puzzle is cracked, it is deleted from the table.
    if (iter->hashed_answer == hashed_answer) {
        print("reveal success! \n");
        records.erase(iter);
    } else {
        print("answer is wrong! \n");
    }
}
```

## Linear\_vesting\_asset

Before reading this tutorial, assume that you have already read the [Overview](#overview)

### 1. Function introduction

####  1.0 Introduction

[linear_vesting_asset合约](https://github.com/gxchain/gxb-core/tree/dev_master/contracts/examples/linear_vesting_asset)contract releases the asset linearly in time to an account. Users can create an asset release task that includes receiving accounts, freezing time, and releasing time.

- **Create a linear release asset task**
```bash
// Create a linear asset release to the `hello` account with a freeze time of 30s and a release time of 120s.
call_contract nathan vesting {"amount":1000000,"asset_id":1.3.1} vestingcreate "{\"to\":\"hello\",\"lock_duration\":30,\"release_duration\":120}" GXC true
unlocked >>> get_table_rows vesting vestingrule 0 -1
[{
    "account_id": 22,
    "vesting_amount": 1000000,
    "vested_amount": 0,
    "lock_time_point": 1542785150,
    "lock_duration": 30,
    "release_time_point": 1542785180,
    "release_duration": 120
  }
]
```
- **Claiming assets**

```bash
// Claiming assets
unlocked >>> call_contract nathan vesting null vestingclaim "{\"who\":\"hello\"}" GXC true
unlocked >>> list_account_balances hello
11 GXC
```
#### 1.1 Compile contract


```bash
./gxx -g /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/linear_vesting_asset/linear_vesting_asset.abi /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/linear_vesting_asset/linear_vesting_asset.cpp

./gxx -o /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/linear_vesting_asset/linear_vesting_asset.wast /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/linear_vesting_asset/linear_vesting_asset.cpp
```

#### 1.2 Deployment contract

```bash
deploy_contract vesting nathan 0 0 /Users/zhaoxiangfei/code/contracts_work/linear_vesting_asset GXC true
```

#### 1.3 Call contract
```bash
// Release the assets to the hello account, release the freeze after 30s, and release all the assets after 120s.
call_contract nathan vesting {"amount":1000000,"asset_id":1.3.1} vestingcreate "{\"to\":\"hello\",\"lock_duration\":30,\"release_duration\":120}" GXC true

// Claim the released assets (it must be claimed after 30s, 30s is the freezing time)
call_contract nathan vesting null vestingclaim "{\"who\":\"hello\"}" GXC true
```

### 2. Code
- The vestingrule table stores fields such as the number of locked assets, lock time, release time, etc.
```cpp
//@abi table vestingrule i64
struct vestingrule {
    uint64_t account_id;        //Claiming the id of the account, two tasks cannot release assets to the same account

    int64_t vesting_amount;     //Release of assets
    int64_t vested_amount;      //Released assets

    int64_t lock_time_point;    //Lock start time
    int64_t lock_duration;      //Locked time
    int64_t release_time_point; //Release start time
    int64_t release_duration;   //Released time

    uint64_t primary_key() const { return account_id; }

    GRAPHENE_SERIALIZE(vestingrule,
       (account_id)(vesting_amount)(vested_amount)(lock_time_point)(lock_duration)(release_time_point)(release_duration))
};
```

- `vestingcreate` creates a linear release asset task; `vestingclaim` claims linearly released assets

```cpp
/// @abi action
/// @abi payable
void vestingcreate(std::string to, int64_t lock_duration, int64_t release_duration)
{
    // Linear release assets only support 'GXC'
    graphene_assert(contract_asset_id == get_action_asset_id(), "not supported asset");
    contract_asset ast{get_action_asset_amount(), contract_asset_id};
    int64_t to_account_id = get_account_id(to.c_str(), to.size());
    // Verify that the claim is valid and that the claim has an locked asset
    graphene_assert(to_account_id >= 0, "invalid account_name to");
    auto lr = vestingrules.find(to_account_id);
    graphene_assert(lr == vestingrules.end(), "have been locked, can only lock one time");

    vestingrules.emplace(0, [&](auto &o) {
        o.account_id = to_account_id;
        o.vesting_amount = ast.amount;
        o.vested_amount = 0;
        o.lock_time_point = get_head_block_time();
        o.lock_duration = lock_duration;
        o.release_time_point = o.lock_time_point + o.lock_duration;
        o.release_duration = release_duration;
    });
}

/// @abi action
void vestingclaim(std::string who)
{   
    // Verify that the claim account id is valid
    int64_t who_account_id = get_account_id(who.c_str(), who.size());
    graphene_assert(who_account_id >= 0, "invalid account_name to");

    // Verify that the account has locked assets to be released
    auto lr = vestingrules.find(who_account_id);
    graphene_assert(lr != vestingrules.end(), "current account have no locked asset");

    // Verify that the asset is in the release period and obtain the number of assets that can be claimed
    uint64_t now = get_head_block_time();
    graphene_assert(now > lr->release_time_point, "within lock duration, can not release");
    int percentage = (now - lr->release_time_point) * 100 / lr->release_duration;
    if (percentage > 100)
        percentage = 100;
    int64_t vested_amount = (int64_t)(1.0f * lr->vesting_amount * percentage / 100);
    vested_amount = vested_amount - lr->vested_amount;
    graphene_assert(vested_amount > 0, "vested amount must > 0");

    // Withdrawal of assets to claim accounts
    withdraw_asset(_self, who_account_id, contract_asset_id, vested_amount);

    // Modify the vesting_amount, vested_amount fields
    vestingrules.modify(lr, 0, [&](auto &o) {
        o.vested_amount += vested_amount;
    });
    if (lr->vesting_amount == lr->vested_amount) {
        vestingrules.erase(lr);
    }
}
```
